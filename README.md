# Gamers Be Gaming': Twtich Marketing

## [Project Proposa](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jw2xJ-hdylPN_xQOLGgnnI2S3JybaXel6lJ4SFmZMuU/edit)

## Description
In this Gamers be Gamin' Consulting session we examine a pair of case studies on twitch interaction.

We provide a breif overview of steam, the largest online game retailer, and twitch, the largest community platform for gaming.

We then look at 2 case studies of companies that did or did not use Twitch to market their game: 
1. LawBreakers did not use twitch when they could have to generate and maintain interest in the game.
2. Hunt: Showdown 1986 extensively used twitch to build up and maintain interest in the game.

To this end we plotted an interactive timeline showing number of twtich streams available to watch vs time, with and Hunt game and twtich events listed for 2019-2020, the period they saw the most growth.

We then have a second interactive visualization that can select top 10 games, + Hunt (a top 50 game). The left plot displays average hours streamed per year in the Twitch top 200, VS lifetime review rating. The right plot dipecits the hours streamed per month timeseries. The games of interest are selectable from the legend.
